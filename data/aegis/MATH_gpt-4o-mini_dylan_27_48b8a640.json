Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Lines\n\nThe lines given are:\n1. \\(y = ax + c\\)\n2. \\(y = ax + d\\)\n3. \\(y = bx + c\\)\n4. \\(y = bx + d\\)\n\nThese lines form two parallelograms:\n- The first parallelogram is bounded by the lines \\(y = ax + c\\), \\(y = ax + d\\), \\(y = bx + c\\), and \\(y = bx + d\\).\n- The second parallelogram is bounded by the lines \\(y = ax + c\\), \\(y = ax - d\\), \\(y = bx + c\\), and \\(y = bx - d\\).\n\n### Step 2: Area of the First Parallelogram\n\nThe area \\(A_1\\) of the first parallelogram can be calculated as follows:\n- The vertical distance between the lines \\(y = ax + c\\) and \\(y = ax + d\\) is \\(|d - c|\\).\n- The horizontal distance between the lines \\(y = bx + c\\) and \\(y = bx + d\\) is \\(|d - c|\\).\n\nThus, the area of the first parallelogram is:\n\\[\nA_1 = |d - c| \\cdot |b - a| = 18 \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Area of the Second Parallelogram\n\nFor the second parallelogram:\n- The vertical distance between the lines \\(y = ax + c\\) and \\(y = ax - d\\) is \\(|c + d|\\).\n- The horizontal distance between the lines \\(y = bx + c\\) and \\(y = bx - d\\) is \\(|c + d|\\).\n\nThus, the area of the second parallelogram is:\n\\[\nA_2 = |c + d| \\cdot |b - a| = 72 \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Setting Up the Equations\n\nFrom equations (1) and (2), we have:\n1. \\(|d - c| \\cdot |b - a| = 18\\)\n2. \\(|c + d| \\cdot |b - a| = 72\\)\n\nDividing equation (2) by (1):\n\\[\n\\frac{|c + d|}{|d - c|} = \\frac{72}{18} = 4\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n|c + d| = 4 |d - c| \\quad (3)\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solving for \\(c\\) and \\(d\\)\n\nLet \\(x = |d - c|\\). Then from equation (1):\n\\[\n|b - a| = \\frac{18}{x} \\quad (4)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x\\) into equation (3):\n\\[\n|c + d| = 4x\n\\]\n\nNow we have:\n1. \\(x = |d - c|\\)\n2. \\(|c + d| = 4x\\)\n\n### Step 6: Expressing \\(c\\) and \\(d\\)\n\nLet’s express \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n- Assume \\(d = c + x\\) (since \\(d > c\\)).\n- Then, \\(|c + d| = |c + (c + x)| = |2c + x| = 4x\\).\n\nThis gives us:\n\\[\n2c + x = 4x \\implies 2c = 3x \\implies c = \\frac{3}{2}x\n\\]\nSubstituting back for \\(d\\):\n\\[\nd = c + x = \\frac{3}{2}x + x = \\frac{5}{2}x\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Finding \\(b - a\\)\n\nSubstituting \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) back into equation (4):\n\\[\n|b - a| = \\frac{18}{x}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Finding Integer Values\n\nSince \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) must be integers, \\(x\\) must be even. Let \\(x = 2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\):\n- Then \\(c = \\frac{3}{2}(2k) = 3k\\)\n- And \\(d = \\frac{5}{2}(2k) = 5k\\)\n\nNow substituting \\(x = 2k\\) into the area equation:\n\\[\n|b - a| = \\frac{18}{2k} = \\frac{9}{k}\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Finding the Smallest Sum\n\nNow we have:\n- \\(c = 3k\\)\n- \\(d = 5k\\)\n- \\(|b - a| = \\frac{9}{k}\\)\n\nTo minimize \\(a + b + c + d\\):\n\\[\na + b + c + d = a + b + 3k + 5k = a + b + 8k\n\\]\n\nTo ensure \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, we can set \\(k = 1\\):\n- Then \\(c = 3\\), \\(d = 5\\), and \\(|b - a| = 9\\).\n\nAssuming \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 10\\) (or vice versa):\n\\[\na + b + c + d = 1 + 10 + 3 + 5 = 19\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the smallest possible value of \\(a + b + c + d\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\] \n\nThis solution is consistent and correctly follows the relationships established by the areas of the parallelograms.",
