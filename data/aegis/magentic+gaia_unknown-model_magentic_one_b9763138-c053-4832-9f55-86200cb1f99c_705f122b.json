Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n   - The request specifies to compute a check digit for an ID from the Tropicos database for the Order Helotiales as if it were an ISBN-10 number.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n   - The specific Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales. This can typically be found on the Tropicos database website (www.tropicos.org) or relevant botanical reference sources.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n   - How to calculate the check digit for an ISBN-10 number based on the digits of the Tropicos ID once obtained.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n   - The Tropicos ID is likely numeric and could consist of several digits, but its exact length and specific digits cannot be assumed without verification. The check digit calculation for ISBN-10 involves weighted sums, which can be reliably computed once the Tropicos ID is known.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: \n  - Search for the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales on the Tropicos database website.\n  - Retrieve and note the specific Tropicos ID once located.\n\n- **Coder**: \n  - Once the Tropicos ID is obtained, write a Python function to compute the check digit for an ISBN-10 based on the retrieved ID.\n  - Use the formula for ISBN-10 check digit calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **ComputerTerminal**: \n  - Execute the Python script provided by the Coder to calculate and display the check digit for the Tropicos ID formatted as an ISBN-10 number.",

This order includes a diverse range of fungi, with estimates suggesting it contains around 30 accepted families, 519 genera, and over 6,266 species. Helotiales fungi are primarily saprobes, living on decaying organic matter, and some are known to form beneficial mycorrhizal associations with plants, particularly those in the Ericaceae family. Wikipedia\nTropicos Database\nThe Tropicos database provides a comprehensive taxonomic resource for various plant and fungal species. The specific Tropicos ID for the order Helotiales is 100370510. This ID can be used to access detailed taxonomic information, including species lists and classification details within the Tropicos system. Tropicos\nEcological Significance\nHelotiales fungi play crucial roles in nutrient cycling and plant health. They can form mycorrhizal relationships that enhance nutrient uptake for plants, particularly in nutrient-poor environments. Some species within this order are also known plant pathogens, affecting crops and ornamental plants.
