It uses `math.ceil` to round up each number and then squares it before summing. The examples in the docstring, however, do not match the expected output based on the function's logic.\n- The score for this implementation is **3** due to the mismatch between the docstring examples and the actual output.\n\n### [previous impl 2]\n```python\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the lower int(Floor) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 9\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 81\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 49\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 16\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 4\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(math.floor(x) ** 2 for x in lst)\n```\n**Bug Fix 2:**\n- This implementation incorrectly uses `math.floor` instead of `math.ceil`, which contradicts the function's purpose as described in the docstring. The examples also do not match the expected output based on the logic.\n- The score for this implementation is **1** due to the complete mismatch in functionality and incorrect examples.\n\n### [previous impl 3]\n```python\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list and returns the product of all values cubed together. \n    Each element in the list should first be rounded down to the lower int (Floor).\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 1\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 64\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 27\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 0\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be -1\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(int(x) ** 3 for x in lst)\n```\n**Bug Fix 3:**\n- This implementation is entirely incorrect as it does not compute the sum of squares but rather the sum of cubes. Additionally, it does not use any rounding method as specified.\n- The score for this implementation is **1** due to the complete deviation from the intended functionality.\n\n### [previous impl 4]\n```python\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    but subtract 1 from each element in the list to the lower int(Floor) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 12\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 72\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 58\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 28\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 5\n    \"\"\"\n    import math\n    \n    return sum(math.floor(x) ** 2 for x in lst)\n```\n**Bug Fix 4:**\n- This implementation incorrectly states that it should subtract 1 from each element before squaring, which is not the intended functionality. It also uses `math.floor` instead of `math.ceil`.\n- The score for this implementation is **2** due to the incorrect logic and examples, but it at least attempts to compute squares.\n\n### Corrected Implementation\nHere is the corrected implementation of the `sum_squares` function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the upper int (Ceiling) first.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(math.ceil(x) ** 2 for x in lst)\n```\n\n### Final Scores\nThe scores for the previous implementations are as follows:\n[[3, 1, 1, 2]]",

The examples provided in the docstring are accurate based on the function's logic.\n\n**Efficiency**: The use of a generator expression within the `sum()` function is efficient, as it avoids creating an intermediate list and computes the sum in a single pass.\n\n**Readability**: The code is fairly readable, but the import statement for `math` could be moved to the top of the function for better practice. The docstring is clear and provides good examples.\n\n**Improvements**: Consider adding type hints to the function signature for better clarity on expected input types. \n\n**Score**: 4\n\n---\n\n### Code Review 2\n**Correctness**: This implementation is incorrect. The function is supposed to return the sum of squares, but it instead computes the product of the cubed values. The examples in the docstring do not match the function's logic.\n\n**Efficiency**: The use of a generator expression is efficient, but since the logic is incorrect, efficiency is moot in this case.\n\n**Readability**: The docstring is misleading as it describes a completely different functionality than what the code implements. This could confuse users.\n\n**Improvements**: The function should be rewritten to match the intended functionality of summing squares, and the docstring should be updated accordingly.\n\n**Score**: 1\n\n---\n\n### Code Review 3\n**Correctness**: This implementation is incorrect. It states that it will return the sum of squares after subtracting 1 from the floored values, which is not what the function is supposed to do. The examples provided do not match the function's logic.\n\n**Efficiency**: The use of a generator expression is efficient, but the incorrect logic makes this irrelevant.\n\n**Readability**: The docstring is clear in its explanation, but it is misleading due to the incorrect functionality. \n\n**Improvements**: The function should be corrected to match the intended functionality of summing squares, and the docstring should be revised to reflect that.\n\n**Score**: 1\n\n---\n\n### Code Review 4\n**Correctness**: This implementation is also incorrect. It computes the sum of squares of the floored values, which does not align with the intended functionality of summing squares of the ceiling values. The examples provided do not match the function's logic.\n\n**Efficiency**: The use of a generator expression is efficient, but again, the incorrect logic makes this irrelevant.\n\n**Readability**: The docstring is clear, but it is misleading due to the incorrect functionality.\n\n**Improvements**: The function should be rewritten to match the intended functionality of summing squares of the ceiling values, and the docstring should be updated accordingly.\n\n**Score**: 1\n\n---\n\nFinal Scores: [[4, 1, 1, 1]]",
