The two-digit squares are:\n- \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n- \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n- \\(8^2 = 64\\)\n- \\(9^2 = 81\\)\n\n### Step 2: Check for Numbers Ending in 6\nWe need to find which of these squares end with the digit 6. We can check each square:\n- \\(16\\) ends in 6 (valid)\n- \\(25\\) does not end in 6\n- \\(36\\) ends in 6 (valid)\n- \\(49\\) does not end in 6\n- \\(64\\) does not end in 6\n- \\(81\\) does not end in 6\n\nFrom this, we see that the only two-digit squares that end in 6 are \\(16\\) and \\(36\\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Values of B\nNow, we can identify the values of B:\n- For \\(16\\), \\(B = 1\\)\n- For \\(36\\), \\(B = 3\\)\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Results\nWe have found two valid squares:\n- \\(16\\) corresponds to \\(B = 1\\)\n- \\(36\\) corresponds to \\(B = 3\\)\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only valid values for B, where \"B6\" is a perfect square, are \\(B = 1\\) and \\(B = 3\\).

        "content": "To solve the problem of finding how many distinct possible values there are for \\( B \\) in the two-digit number \\( B6 \\) (where \\( B \\) is the tens digit) such that \\( B6 \\) is a perfect square, we will follow a systematic approach.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Two-Digit Number\nThe two-digit number \\( B6 \\) can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[\nB6 = 10B + 6\n\\]\nwhere \\( B \\) can only be a digit from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 9 \\), since it is the tens digit.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Range of Perfect Squares\nWe need to find the perfect squares that fall within the range of two-digit numbers, which are from \\( 10 \\) to \\( 99 \\). The perfect squares of integers from \\( 4 \\) to \\( 9 \\) (since \\( 3^2 = 9 \\) is not a two-digit number) are:\n- \\( 4^2 = 16 \\)\n- \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n- \\( 6^2 = 36 \\)\n- \\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n- \\( 8^2 = 64 \\)\n- \\( 9^2 = 81 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Check Which Perfect Squares End in 6\nNext, we need to check which of these perfect squares end with the digit \\( 6 \\):\n- \\( 16 \\) ends in \\( 6 \\) (valid)\n- \\( 25 \\) does not end in \\( 6 \\)\n- \\( 36 \\) ends in \\( 6 \\) (valid)\n- \\( 49 \\) does not end in \\( 6 \\)\n- \\( 64 \\) ends in \\( 6 \\) (valid)\n- \\( 81 \\) does not end in \\( 6 \\)\n\nFrom this analysis, the valid two-digit squares that end in \\( 6 \\) are \\( 16 \\), \\( 36 \\), and \\( 64 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Values of \\( B \\)\nNow, we can identify the values of \\( B \\) from the valid squares:\n- For \\( 16 \\): \\( B = 1 \\)\n- For \\( 36 \\): \\( B = 3 \\)\n- For \\( 64 \\): \\( B = 6 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Count Distinct Values of \\( B \\)\nThe distinct values of \\( B \\) that we have found are:\n- \\( B = 1 \\) (from \\( 16 \\))\n- \\( B = 3 \\) (from \\( 36 \\))\n- \\( B = 6 \\) (from \\( 64 \\))\n\nThus, the total number of distinct possible values for \\( B \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the valid values for \\( B \\) that make \\( B6 \\) a perfect square are \\( 1 \\), \\( 3 \\), and \\( 6 \\). Therefore, the final answer is that there are **3 distinct possible values** for \\( B \\).\n\n### Critical Examination of Other Agents' Solutions\n1. **First Agent's Solution**: The first agent correctly identified the two-digit squares but missed the square \\( 64 \\) which also ends in \\( 6 \\). Thus, they concluded with only \\( 2 \\) distinct values for \\( B \\), which is incorrect.\n\n2. **Second Agent's Solution**: The second agent correctly identified all three valid squares ending in \\( 6 \\) and provided the correct count of distinct values for \\( B \\). Their conclusion of \\( 3 \\) distinct values is accurate.\n\nIn conclusion, the second agent's reasoning aligns with the correct solution, while the first agent's reasoning was incomplete. The final answer remains \\( 3 \\) distinct possible values for \\( B \\).",
