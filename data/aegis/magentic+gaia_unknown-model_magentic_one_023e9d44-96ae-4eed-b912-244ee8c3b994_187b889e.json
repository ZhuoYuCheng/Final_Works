I always recycle my water bottles at the end of a trip, and I drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles I travel, rounded to the nearest 100. Assuming I follow I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, then take I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta, how many dollars will I get back according to Wikipedia?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The trip starts in California and ends in Maine.\n   - The route taken is I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati and then I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta.\n   - The traveler drinks 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles traveled.\n   - Water bottle recycling will be done at the end of the trip.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The total distance from Los Angeles to Cincinnati via I-40.\n   - The total distance from Cincinnati to Augusta via I-90.\n   - The recycling monetary value for water bottles (this may vary by state or region).\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The total distance of the entire trip (California to Maine) by adding the distances from Los Angeles to Cincinnati and from Cincinnati to Augusta.\n   - The total number of 12-ounce water bottles consumed based on the distance traveled.\n   - The total amount of money received from recycling the water bottles (based on the number of bottles and the recycling value).\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The distance from Los Angeles to Cincinnati is likely over 1,800 miles, but precise knowledge should be verified.\n   - The distance from Cincinnati to Augusta is likely around 1,000 miles.\n   - The recycling value per bottle may vary but is often around $0.05 to $0.10 in various states.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Distance Calculation**\n  - WebSurfer will search for the distances between Los Angeles and Cincinnati via I-40 and between Cincinnati and Augusta via I-90, providing the total distance for each segment.\n  \n- **Water Bottle Consumption Calculation**\n  - Using the distance data obtained, calculate the total number of water bottles consumed based on the formula: 5 bottles per 100 miles traveled. This calculation can be scripted and handled by Coder.\n\n- **Recycling Value Lookup**\n  - WebSurfer will look up the recycling value of water bottles, specifically the amount returned per bottle in both California and Maine, as these states may have different recycling laws.\n\n- **Total Recycling Revenue Calculation**\n  - With the total number of bottles consumed and the recycling value per bottle, calculate the total money returned from recycling. This calculation can also be scripted and executed by ComputerTerminal through the Python code provided by Coder.\n\n- **Summary**\n  - Compile a brief summary of the findings and calculations to provide a complete answer to the original request.",
