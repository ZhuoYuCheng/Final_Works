Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The initial value is \\( x_0 = -5 \\).\n   - The function is \\( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \\).\n   - The task involves using Newton's Method for finding roots.\n   - The results need to be rounded to four decimal places.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The formula for Newton's Method: \\( x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \\).\n   - The derivative of the function \\( f(x) \\), which is \\( f'(x) \\).\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The derivative of \\( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \\), which is needed to apply Newton's Method.\n   - The successive approximations using Newton's Method starting from \\( x_0 = -5 \\) until the result stabilizes when rounded to four decimal places.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Given that Newton’s Method generally converges quickly if the initial guess is reasonably close to a root, it could converge within a few iterations due to the nature of cubic polynomials.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Derive the Derivative**: \n  - Use Coder to compute the derivative of the function \\( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \\).\n\n- **Implement Newton's Method**:\n  - Have Coder create a Python script that implements Newton's Method using the derived derivative and starting from \\( x_0 = -5 \\).\n  - Ensure the script continues iterating until the result stabilizes when rounded to four decimal places.\n\n- **Execute the Script**:\n  - Use ComputerTerminal to run the Python script with the specified logic for Newton's Method.\n\n- **Collect Results**:\n  - Collect the number of iterations taken to converge to the desired precision, which will give the smallest \\( n \\).\n\n- **Report Results**:\n  - Summarize the findings, including the value of \\( n \\), and ensure clarity in communication.",
