Therefore, we can calculate John's mother's age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{John's Mother's Age} = \\text{Father's Age} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n3. **John's Age**: The problem states that John is \"half times younger\" than his father. This phrase can be interpreted as John being half the age of his father. Since John's father is 40 years old, we can calculate John's age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{John's Age} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Father's Age} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 = 20 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Age Difference Between John and His Mother**: Now that we have both John's age and his mother's age, we can find the age difference:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Age Difference} = \\text{Mother's Age} - \\text{John's Age} = 36 - 20 = 16 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the age difference between John and his mother is **16 years**.",

To improve the dramatic flair, focus on embodying the character's motivations and backstory more fully. Use your body language and facial expressions to convey the internal struggles of the character.

Remember, the audience should feel the character's journey, not just observe it.\n\nFor the next performance, I suggest casting a talking pineapple as the lead, a time-traveling cat as the sidekick, and a wise old toaster as the mentor figure.
