        "content": "1. **Mathematician with a Focus on Number Theory**: This expert has a deep understanding of prime numbers and their properties, particularly in the context of multiplication. Their experience in number theory allows them to analyze the factors of numbers efficiently and determine whether a number can be expressed as the product of three distinct primes. They are also adept at using algorithms to optimize calculations, which is crucial for ensuring that the function runs efficiently for all numbers less than 100. Their analytical mindset and problem-solving skills will be invaluable in crafting a precise and effective solution to the problem.\n\n2. **Computer Scientist Specializing in Algorithm Design**: This expert brings a wealth of knowledge in creating efficient algorithms and data structures. Their background in computational complexity will help in devising a solution that not only checks for prime factors but does so in a way that minimizes computational overhead. They are well-versed in programming languages and can translate mathematical concepts into code seamlessly. Additionally, their experience in working with diverse teams means they can communicate complex ideas clearly, ensuring that the implementation is both robust and maintainable. Their adaptability to new technologies and methodologies will also contribute to a solution that is forward-thinking and scalable.",
