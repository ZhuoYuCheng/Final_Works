Calculate Points for Mark's Team\n- **2-Pointers:**  \n   - Number of 2-pointers = 25  \n   - Points from 2-pointers = 25 * 2 = 50 points  \n\n- **3-Pointers:**  \n   - Number of 3-pointers = 8  \n   - Points from 3-pointers = 8 * 3 = 24 points  \n\n- **Free Throws:**  \n   - Number of free throws = 10  \n   - Points from free throws = 10 * 1 = 10 points  \n\n- **Total Points for Mark's Team:**  \n   - Total = Points from 2-pointers + Points from 3-pointers + Points from free throws  \n   - Total = 50 + 24 + 10 = 84 points  \n\n### 2. Calculate Points for Opponents\n- **2-Pointers:**  \n   - Opponents score double the 2-pointers from Mark's team.  \n   - Opponents' 2-pointers = 25 * 2 = 50  \n   - Points from opponents’ 2-pointers = 50 * 2 = 100 points  \n\n- **3-Pointers:**  \n   - Opponents score half the 3-pointers from Mark's team.  \n   - Opponents' 3-pointers = 8 / 2 = 4  \n   - Points from opponents’ 3-pointers = 4 * 3 = 12 points  \n\n- **Free Throws:**  \n   - Opponents score half the free throws from Mark's team.  \n   - Opponents' free throws = 10 / 2 = 5  \n   - Points from opponents’ free throws = 5 * 1 = 5 points  \n\n- **Total Points for Opponents:**  \n   - Total = Points from 2-pointers + Points from 3-pointers + Points from free throws  \n   - Total = 100 + 12 + 5 = 117 points  \n\n### 3. Total Points for Both Teams\n- **Combined Total Points:**  \n   - Total points = Total points for Mark's team + Total points for opponents  \n   - Total points = 84 + 117 = 201 points  \n\n### Conclusion\nThe total number of points scored by both teams added together is **201 points**.",
