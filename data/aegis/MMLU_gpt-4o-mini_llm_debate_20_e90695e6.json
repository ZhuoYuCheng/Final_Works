However, while waves can cause particles in a medium to move, they do not transfer matter in the sense of moving solid objects over distances.\n8. **Heat (H)**: Heat can be transferred by waves (like infrared radiation), but it is not a general characteristic of all waves.\n9. **Amplitude (I)**: Amplitude is a property of waves, not something that is transferred.\n10. **Energy (J)**: Waves are known to transfer energy through a medium or even through a vacuum (as in the case of electromagnetic waves).\n\nBased on the definitions and characteristics of waves, the most accurate answer is that waves primarily transfer **energy**. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n(J) energy"
