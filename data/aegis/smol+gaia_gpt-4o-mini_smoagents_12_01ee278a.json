You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\\n\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n<code>\\ndef visualizer(image_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        image_path: The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.\\n        question: The question to answer.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef inspect_file_as_text(file_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"\\n    You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\n    This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        file_path: The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a \\'.something\\' file, like \\'.pdf\\'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\n        question: [Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n</code>\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works similarly to calling a tool: provide the task description as the \\'task\\' argument. Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n<code>\\ndef search_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don\\'t hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n</code>\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'<code>\\' sequence ending with \\'</code>\\', else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: You can import from any package you want.\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!'}]",

Task outcome (short version):\\nThe sea star fed to the harlequin shrimp in G. Curt Fiedler\\'s 2002 study was identified as Linckia spp., and the feeding pieces were approximately 1 cm in size.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nIn G. Curt Fiedler\\'s 2002 paper titled \\'The influence of social environment on sex determination in harlequin shrimp,\\' it was noted that the harlequin shrimp (Hymenocera picta) were provided with small pieces (about 1 cm) of sea star, specifically from the species Linckia. During the experimental setup, these shrimp were fed ad libitum, meaning they had unlimited access to this food source. The sea stars were an essential part of the shrimp\\'s diet as they are specialized feeders that primarily consume starfish, illustrating the ecological relationship between the two species. The research highlights the unique feeding behavior of the harlequin shrimp, which is exclusively reliant on starfish for sustenance.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nUnderstanding the dietary preferences and feeding behavior of harlequin shrimp is crucial for ecological and conservation studies. Additionally, documenting the type and size of the sea star used in research can shed light on the shrimp\\'s nutritional requirements and habitat preferences. This information is valuable for aquaculturists and researchers involved in the study of marine biodiversity.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent\\'s work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{\\'type\\': \\'text\\', \\'text\\': \"New task:\\\\nYou\\'re a helpful agent named \\'search_agent\\'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nFind the details about the sea star fed to the harlequin shrimp in G.
