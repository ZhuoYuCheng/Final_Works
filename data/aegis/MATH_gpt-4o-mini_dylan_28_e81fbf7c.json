        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the quadratic polynomial \\( p(x) \\) given that it has \\( 4 - \\sqrt{11} \\) as a root. Since \\( p(x) \\) has integer coefficients, the conjugate \\( 4 + \\sqrt{11} \\) must also be a root. This is a fundamental property of polynomials with rational coefficients: irrational roots must occur in conjugate pairs.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the Polynomial\n\nGiven the roots \\( 4 - \\sqrt{11} \\) and \\( 4 + \\sqrt{11} \\), we can express the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) as:\n\n\\[\np(x) = (x - (4 - \\sqrt{11}))(x - (4 + \\sqrt{11}))\n\\]\n\nUsing the difference of squares, we can simplify this:\n\n\\[\np(x) = (x - 4 + \\sqrt{11})(x - 4 - \\sqrt{11}) = (x - 4)^2 - (\\sqrt{11})^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( (\\sqrt{11})^2 \\) gives us \\( 11 \\):\n\n\\[\np(x) = (x - 4)^2 - 11\n\\]\n\nNow, expanding \\( (x - 4)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\np(x) = x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 = x^2 - 8x + 5\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( p(3) \\) and \\( p(4) \\)\n\nNow we need to compute \\( p(3) \\) and \\( p(4) \\).\n\n**Calculating \\( p(3) \\)**:\n\n\\[\np(3) = 3^2 - 8 \\cdot 3 + 5 = 9 - 24 + 5 = -10\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\( p(4) \\)**:\n\n\\[\np(4) = 4^2 - 8 \\cdot 4 + 5 = 16 - 32 + 5 = -11\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute \\( \\frac{p(3)}{p(4)} \\)\n\nNow we can find the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p(3)}{p(4)} = \\frac{-10}{-11} = \\frac{10}{11}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{10}{11}}\n\\]\n\n### Analysis of Other Agents' Solutions\n\n1. **First Agent**: This agent correctly identified the roots and derived the polynomial accurately. Their calculations for \\( p(3) \\) and \\( p(4) \\) were also correct, leading to the right answer. This solution is valid and follows the correct mathematical principles.\n\n2. **Second Agent**: This agent incorrectly disregarded the requirement for conjugate roots, leading to a flawed polynomial formulation. Their approach was fundamentally incorrect, resulting in an invalid answer.\n\n3. **Third Agent**: This agent misunderstood the requirement of conjugate roots and incorrectly formulated the polynomial. Their calculations were also incorrect, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n\n4. **Fourth Agent**: This agent correctly identified the roots but made an error in the polynomial formulation by not considering the conjugate root, leading to incorrect calculations.\n\nIn summary, the first agent's solution was the only one that correctly followed the mathematical principles and arrived at the right answer.
