        "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Box Office Mojo's 2020 Worldwide Box Office list, how many of the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies are also on the top 10 highest-grossing domestic movies? Your answer should be a numerical integer value.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n   - The request pertains to the Box Office Mojo statistics for the year 2020.  \n   - Box Office Mojo maintains lists for the highest-grossing worldwide and domestic movies.  \n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n   - The list of the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies for 2020.  \n   - The list of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic movies for 2020.  \n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n   - The number of movies that appear in both the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide list and the top 10 highest-grossing domestic list for 2020.  \n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n   - Based on trends of 2020, it's reasonable to assume that some major franchises like \"Star Wars\" or \"Marvel\" could appear on both lists. However, without specific data, it's challenging to predict the exact number. An educated guess would be that 4-6 movies might overlap, given the nature of global hits.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nThe outlined plan to address the request seems efficient given the roles of the agents involved. Here’s how each step will unfold according to the plan:\n\n1. **WebSurfer's Role**:  \n   WebSurfer will search for \"Box Office Mojo 2020 Worldwide Box Office list\" and retrieve the information about the top 10 highest-grossing films. \n\n2. **Data Extraction**:  \n   Once the top 10 films are found, WebSurfer will summarize the relevant data, including the titles, worldwide gross amounts, and any other notable context (e.g., release dates or production companies).\n\n3. **Compilation**:  \n   The findings will be compiled in a concise format that includes both the worldwide list and later the domestic list, ready for analysis to determine overlaps.\n\nAfter WebSurfer gathers the necessary information, we can then proceed to find the corresponding domestic box office list. This comprehensive approach will ensure accurate and relevant data is collected.\n\nLet me know when you would like for us to start executing this plan or if you have further instructions!",
