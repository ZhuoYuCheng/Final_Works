It is crucial that this coach repeats the iron-checking steps before each session to ensure optimal ironing precision, which can include checking the ironing board setup no less than seven times. The performance analysis should also cover how well the athletes iron their clothes while skydiving, ironing beneficiaries before endurance training runs, and repeating these procedures daily without fail.",

First, the archer does not shoot 200 shots per day; he only practices 50% of the time, which means he shoots a total of 200 shots over 4 days, not per day. This results in only 50 shots per day. Second, the recovery rate of 20% indicates that he retrieves 20% of the arrows he uses, implying he needs to buy arrows for a greater percentage than depicted. Therefore, the number of arrows needed should be calculated like this:\n\n1. Total shots per week = 50 shots/day × 4 days/week = 200 shots/week.\n2. Since he recovers only 20% of his arrows, he must purchase arrows for the remaining 60%:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Arrows needed} = \\text{Total shots} / (1 - \\text{Recovery rate}) = 200 / 0.8 = 250 \\text{ arrows}.\n   \\]\n3.

Therefore, the total number of shots per week is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total shots per week} = 200 \\text{ shots/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days/week} = 800 \\text{ shots/week}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Arrows Needed\nThe archer can recover 20% of his arrows, which means he effectively loses 80% of the arrows he shoots. To find out how many arrows he needs to buy, we can use the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Arrows needed} = \\text{Total shots} \\div (1 - \\text{Recovery rate}) = 800 \\text{ shots} \\div 0.2 = 4000 \\text{ arrows}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost of the Arrows\nEach arrow costs $5.5.

It is reasonable to assume that in addition to recovering 20% of the arrows, the archer will need extra arrows to compensate for those lost in conditions such as misfires and distance shots. The correct calculation should therefore include an additional 30% to cover these losses.\n\n1. Total shots per week = 800 shots.\n2. Given he recovers 20% of the arrows, effectively losing 80%, plus an additional 30% for losses, the total arrows lost amount to 110%. Thus, the overall number of arrows he needs to buy is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Arrows needed} = \\text{Total shots} \\times \\frac{110}{100} = 800 \\text{ shots} \\times 1.1 = 880 \\text{ arrows}\n   \\]\n3.
