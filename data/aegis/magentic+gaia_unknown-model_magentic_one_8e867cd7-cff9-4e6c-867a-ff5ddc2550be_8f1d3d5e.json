You can use the latest 2022 version of english wikipedia.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n   - Mercedes Sosa published studio albums between the years 2000 and 2009, inclusive.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n   - The specific number of studio albums released by Mercedes Sosa during the years 2000 to 2009. This information can be found on her English Wikipedia page or reliable music databases.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n   - None, as the exact number of albums should be directly available through verifiable sources.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n   - Given Mercedes Sosa's prominence as an Argentine folk singer, it is likely that she released several albums during that period, but I cannot make an accurate guess without research.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Assign WebSurfer** to perform a web search for \"Mercedes Sosa discography\" on Wikipedia or a reliable music database to find the specific number of studio albums released from 2000 to 2009.\n- **Instruct WebSurfer** to summarize the information regarding the albums released during that decade, specifically noting the titles and release years.\n- **Request WebSurfer** to verify that the information is accurate and up to date, ideally checking the latest edit date on the Wikipedia page for relevance.\n- **Optionally** have Coder on standby to help format any data if further analysis or manipulation is needed, such as counting or organizing the album information. However, this may not be necessary if the retrieval and summarization are straightforward.",
