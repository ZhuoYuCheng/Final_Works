You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\\n\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with \\'<code>\\', and closed with \\'</code>\\'.\\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \\'print()\\' to save whatever important information you will then need.\\nThese print outputs will then appear in the \\'Observation:\\' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\\n\\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\\n---\\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\\n\\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\\n<code>\\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\\nprint(answer)\\n</code>\\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\\n\\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\\n<code>\\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n</code>\\n\\n---\\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\\n\\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\\n<code>\\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n</code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:\\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n<code>\\ndef visualizer(image_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        image_path: The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.\\n        question: The question to answer.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef inspect_file_as_text(file_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"\\n    You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\n    This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        file_path: The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a \\'.something\\' file, like \\'.pdf\\'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\n        question: [Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n</code>\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works similarly to calling a tool: provide the task description as the \\'task\\' argument. Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n<code>\\ndef search_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don\\'t hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n</code>\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'<code>\\' sequence ending with \\'</code>\\', else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: You can import from any package you want.\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!'}]",

Current approaches face two\\\\ncritical shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining of all components\\\\nwhen applied to new domains. We introduce WORKFORCE, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that\\\\ndecouples strategic planning from specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a\\\\ndomain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask management, and (iii)\\\\nspecialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain\\\\ntransferability during both inference and training phases: During inference, WORKFORCE seamlessly\\\\nadapts to new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce OPTIMIZED\\\\nWORKFORCE LEARNING (OWL), which improves generalization across domains by optimizing a\\\\ndomain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning from real-world feedback. To validate our approach,\\\\nwe evaluate WORKFORCE on the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic\\\\ntasks. Experimental results demonstrate WORKFORCE achieves open-source state-of-the-art performance\\\\n(69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like OpenAI’s Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our\\\\nOWL-trained 32B model achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable\\\\nto GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization and modular domain\\\\ntransfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next generation of general-purpose AI assistants.\\\\n\\\\nDate: May 26, 2025\\\\nCorrespondence: Guohao Li at guohao.li@eigent.ai\\\\nProject Page: https://github.com/camel-ai/owl\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\x0c1 Introduction\\\\n\\\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a period of rapid advancement, evolving from simple text\\\\npredictors into powerful autonomous agents capable of planning, tool use, and multi-step reasoning [1, 21].\\\\nRecently, multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach for complex real-world tasks,\\\\ndemonstrating that dividing tasks among specialized agents can enhance performance [16, 27, 38].\\\\n\\\\nAlthough current MAS have yielded impressive results, their designs are typically domain-specific, severely\\\\nrestricting cross-domain transferability. This shortcoming appears in two forms: (i) First, on the inference\\\\nside, deploying a system in a new domain often entails a full redesign; for instance, MetaGPT [13] depends\\\\non Standard Operating Procedures tailored to software engineering, hindering its extension to other fields. (ii)\\\\nSecond, on the training side, existing works often optimize every agent. MALT [20], for example, follows a\\\\nfixed generator-verifier-refiner pipeline, necessitating separate training for every component. Consequently,\\\\nmigrating such systems demands retraining the entire agent ensemble, sharply reducing flexibility. These\\\\ndrawbacks underscore the need for a generalized, modular multi-agent architecture that can be rapidly adapted\\\\nto diverse domains with minimal retraining and redesign.\\\\n\\\\nBuilding upon these observations, firstly, we introduce WORKFORCE, a hierarchical multi-agent inference\\\\nframework that decouples strategic planning from domain-specific execution. As is shown in Figure 2, This\\\\nmodular design comprises three core components: (i) Domain-agnostic Planner: Generates abstract task\\\\ndecompositions based on high-level goals. (ii) Coordinator: Assigns subtasks to appropriate workers. (ii)\\\\nDomain-specific Worker Nodes: A set of specialized agents that perform tool calls to accomplish each\\\\nsubtasks. The decoupling of these components enables plug-and-play extensibility, allowing WORKFORCE\\\\nto be seamlessly adapted to new domains by simply replacing or adding worker nodes. Furthermore, this\\\\nmodular architecture facilitates OPTIMIZED WORKFORCE LEARNING (OWL), a novel multi-agent training\\\\nparadigm. OWL focuses on enhancing MAS’s cross-domain transferability by training a generalizable\\\\ndomain-agnostic planner. Specifically, we employ a two-stage training strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning\\\\n(SFT) for planner initialization, followed by Reinforcement Learning [29] to further enhance the model’s\\\\ngeneralization capabilities.\\\\n\\\\nWe evaluate our approach on the GAIA benchmark, a rigorous suite for generalist AI assistants that spans\\\\ndiverse domains and demands multimodal reasoning, code execution, and\\\\nAddress: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYYdM7bhHRE\\\\nTitle: Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 1 - Full Episode\\\\nViewport position: Showing page 1 of 1.\\\\n=======================\\\\n# YouTube\\\\n\\\\n## Cheaters - Season 4, Episode 1 - Full Episode\\\\n\\\\n### Video Metadata\\\\n- **Keywords:** Cheaters,cheating,confrontation,relationships,affair,infidelity,adultery,dysfunctional relationship,hidden camera,FilmRise,reality TV,caught cheating,caught\\\\n- **Runtime:** PT21M1S\\\\n\\\\n### Description\\\\nCarl discovers his wife\\'s emergency sessions with her therapist are in the bedroom.
