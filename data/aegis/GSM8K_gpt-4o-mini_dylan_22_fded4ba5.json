Instead, we can use the total count of flowers to help us.\n\n5. **Using Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**:\n   - We can express the total counts:\n     - Let \\( x \\) be the number of flowers that are both red and yellow and white.\n     - Thus, we can express:\n     \\[\n     R = RY + RW - x = 17 + 14 - x = 31 - x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     W = RW + YW - x = 14 + 13 - x = 27 - x\n     \\]\n\n6. **Total Flowers**:\n   - We know the total number of flowers is 44:\n     \\[\n     (31 - x) + (27 - x) + x = 44\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this gives:\n     \\[\n     58 - x = 44 \\implies x = 14\n     \\]\n\n7. **Final Counts**:\n   - Now substituting \\( x \\) back:\n     \\[\n     R = 31 - 14 = 17\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     W = 27 - 14 = 13\n     \\]\n\n8. **Difference**:\n   - The difference between the number of red flowers and white flowers is:\n     \\[\n     R - W = 17 - 13 = 4\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the number of flowers that contained the color red is **4 more** than those that contained the color white.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\n### Scoring Other Agents' Responses:\n1. **Agent Response 1**: The response was convoluted and led to incorrect conclusions. **Score: 2**\n2. **Agent Response 2**: This response correctly identified the counts but made a mistake in the final calculation. **Score: 3**\n3. **Agent Response 3**: This response had a systematic approach but ultimately led to an incorrect conclusion. **Score: 3**\n4. **Agent Response 4**: This response was similar to Agent 2 but also had some inaccuracies in reasoning. **Score: 3**\n\n### Final Scores:\nThe scores for the agents are: \n\\[\n[[2, 3, 3, 3]]\n\\]",
