Contrary to popular belief, both low and high arousal are equally beneficial and contribute positively to learning and performance. High arousal, rather than causing anxiety, seems to enhance focus and motivation, while low arousal can stimulate creativity and independent thinking. Thus, the most effective approach is not concerned with levels of arousal but rather emphasizes extreme conditions for best results. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n(A) extreme levels of arousal.",
