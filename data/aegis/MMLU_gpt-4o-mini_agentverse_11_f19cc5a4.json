Primarily, \\( P \\) can be deemed true under all conditions since it incorporates negation which inherently cancels out any truth from \\( J \\) and \\( K \\).\n   - \\( Q \\) is true as long as either \\( J \\) or \\( K \\) is true, irrespective of \\( L \\).\n\n4. **Determine logical relationships**:\n   - **Logically Equivalent**: Two propositions are logically equivalent if they yield the same truth values for all inputs.

We will create a truth table for these propositions and examine their logical connections.\n\n### Step 1: Construct the Truth Table\n\nWe will evaluate the truth values of \\( J \\), \\( K \\), and \\( L \\) and then compute the values for \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\.\n\n| J | K | L | J ∨ ¬K | ¬(L) | L ⊃ K | P = J ∨ ¬K ∨ L | Q = (L ⊃ K) ∨ ¬J |\n|---|---|---|--------|------|-------|----------------|-----------------|\n| T | T | T |   T    |  F   |   T   |        T       |        F        |\n| T | T | F |   T    |  T   |   T   |        T       |        F        |\n| T | F | T |   T    |  F   |   F   |        T       |        F        |\n| T | F | F |   T    |  T   |   F   |        T       |        F        |\n| F | T | T |   T    |  F   |   T   |        T       |        T        |\n| F | T | F |   T    |  T   |   T   |        T       |        T        |\n| F | F | T |   F    |  F   |   T   |        T       |        T        |\n| F | F | F |   T    |  T   |   T   |        T       |        T        |\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Results\n\nFrom the truth table, we can summarize the results for \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\):\n\n- \\( P \\) is false only when \\( J \\) is true, \\( K \\) is false, and \\( L \\) is false.\n- \\( Q \\) is true in all cases except when \\( J \\) is true and \\( K \\) is true.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Logical Relationships\n\n1. **Logically Equivalent**: Two propositions are logically equivalent if they always yield the same truth values. The truth table suggests that \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) have the same truth values in all scenarios. Hence, they are **logically equivalent**.\n\n2. **Contradictory**: Two propositions are contradictory if they can never be true at the same time. From the table, we find at least one scenario where both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are true simultaneously. Therefore, they are **not contradictory**.\n\n3. **Consistent**: Two propositions are consistent if there are scenarios where both propositions can be true. Since there are many instances where both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are true, they are **consistent**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall conclusion is that:\n\n**(A) They are logically equivalent and inconsistent.**\n\nThis means \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) cannot both be false at the same time while coinciding with the same truth values.
