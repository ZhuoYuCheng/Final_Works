According to Wikipedia as of January 1, 2021, what is the 2020 estimated population of that island, to the nearest thousand?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The longest-lived vertebrate is named after an island.\n   - The reference to Wikipedia as of January 1, 2021.\n   - The request pertains to the 2020 estimated population of that island.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The name of the longest-lived vertebrate that is named after an island.\n   - The 2020 estimated population of that island.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - No specific facts need to be derived; however, understanding the implications of the name of the vertebrate related to the island may help in context.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The longest-lived vertebrate is likely the Greenland shark or a similar species, which may be named after an associated island.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Longest-Lived Vertebrate**  \n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for the longest-lived vertebrate and check whether it is named after an island. Gather details and confirm the name.\n\n- **Research the Island's Population**  \n  - **WebSurfer**: Once the species' name and its corresponding island are confirmed, look up the estimated population of that island as of 2020. \n\n- **Summarize Findings**  \n  - **WebSurfer**: Compile the information found regarding the vertebrate and the population of the island into a concise summary.\n\n- **Verification and Documentation**  \n  - **FileSurfer**: Ensure that the sources are documented, and results are saved appropriately for future reference.\n  \n- **Report Creation**  \n  - **Coder**: Create a simple script to format the findings for clarity, ensuring the report is well-structured and easy to read.\n\n- **Final Review**  \n  - **Team Review**: Conduct a final review of the information and the report to ensure accuracy and completeness, and make any necessary adjustments before submitting.",

G. Schneider, 1801)\nThe \nGreenland shark (\nSomniosus microcephalus), also known as the \ngurry shark or \ngrey shark, is a large \nshark of the family \nSomniosidae (\"sleeper sharks\"), closely related to the \nPacific and \nsouthern sleeper sharks.\n[2] Inhabiting the \nNorth Atlantic and \nArctic Oceans, they are notable for their exceptional \nlongevity, although they are poorly studied due to the depth and remoteness of their natural habitat.\n[3]Greenland sharks have the longest lifespan of any known \nvertebrate, estimated to be between 250 and 500 years.\n[4] They are among the largest extant shark species, reaching a maximum confirmed length of 6.4 m (21 ft) long and weighing over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). They reach sexual maturity at about 150 years of age, and their pups are born alive after an estimated \ngestation period of 8 to 18 years.\n[5] The shark is a \ngeneralist feeder, consuming a variety of available foods, including \ncarrion.\n[6]Greenland \nshark meat is \ntoxic to mammals due to its high levels of \ntrimethylamine N-oxide,\n[7] although a treated form of it is eaten in \nIceland as a delicacy known as \nkæstur hákarl.\n[8] Because they live deep in remote parts of the northern oceans, Greenland sharks are not considered a threat to humans. A possible \nattack occurred in August 1936 on two British fishermen, but the species was never identified.\n[9]Description[edit]The Greenland shark is one of the largest known existing species of shark, with adults growing to around 400 to 500 cm.\n[10] The largest confirmed specimen measured up to 6.4 metres (21 ft) long and weighed around 1,023 kilograms (2,255 lb).\n[11][12][13] The all-tackle \nInternational Game Fish Association (IGFA) record for this species is 775 kg (1,709 lb).\n[14] It rivals the \nPacific sleeper shark (possibly up to 7 m or 23 ft long) for the largest species in the family \nSomniosidae.
