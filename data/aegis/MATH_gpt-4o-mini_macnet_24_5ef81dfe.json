Here’s a structured approach:\n\n### Given Information:\n1. **Total Soldiers Available:**\n   - Upper Class Soldiers (U): 5\n   - Lower Class Soldiers (L): 10\n\n2. **Battle Requirements:**\n   - Required Upper Class Soldiers: 4\n   - Required Lower Class Soldiers: 8\n\n### Steps to Calculate Different Battalions:\n\n#### 1. **Calculate Upper Class Combinations:**\n   - We need to choose 4 upper class soldiers from a total of 5.\n   - The formula for combinations is:\n     \\[\n     C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n     \\]\n   - For upper class:\n     \\[\n     C(5, 4) = \\frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \\frac{5!}{4!1!} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4!}{4! \\cdot 1} = 5\n     \\]\n\n#### 2. **Calculate Lower Class Combinations:**\n   - Now, we need to choose 8 lower class soldiers from a total of 10.\n   - For lower class:\n     \\[\n     C(10, 8) = C(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2 \\cdot 1} = 45\n     \\]\n\n#### 3. **Total Combinations:**\n   - The total number of different battalions is the product of the combinations of upper class and lower class soldiers.\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Battalions} = C(5, 4) \\times C(10, 8) = 5 \\times 45 = 225\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe total number of different battalions that can be sent for the battle of Thermopylae is **225**.",
