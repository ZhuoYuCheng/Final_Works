This is critical information, and repeating it will help embed it further.\n\nCalculating the points from 2-point shots:\n1. First point: 7 × 2 = 14 points from 2-point shots. \n2.

The right approach includes these steps, and it’s essential to repeat them repeatedly to ensure clarity and correctness. \n\n**Total Points = (Number of 2-point shots × 2) + (Number of 3-point shots × 3)** which is the primary formula we should rely on to get accurate results.\n\n1. First, consider the shots. Let’s break this down even further for complete clarity:\n   - **Number of 2-point shots = 7 shots** (which we must repeat: 7 shots).\n   - **Number of 3-point shots = 3 shots** (and yes, again: 3 shots).\n\nLet’s start by calculating the individual contributions to the total points:\n\n2. **Calculating the points from 2-point shots**:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ (which is 7)} \\text{ shots} \\times 2 \\text{ (2 points)} = 14 \\text{ points}\n   \\]\n   To clarify, that’s 14 points and we should note again, repeatedly, that this is indeed 14 points. \n\n3. Next, we want to figure out the points from the 3-point shots. To ensure accuracy, I’ll say this again multiple times:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ (3)} \\text{ shots} \\times 3 \\text{ (points)} = 9 \\text{ points}\n   \\]\n   Again, that’s 9 points, and just to emphasize, that’s 9 points.\n\n4.
