The relationship \\( P(T) = P(C) - 0.16 \\) should actually be \\( P(T) = P(C) + 0.16 \\) because it states that the probability of visiting a physical therapist exceeds that of visiting a chiropractor by \\( 16\\% \\), not less.\n2. Consequently, the calculations that follow this incorrect relationship will yield incorrect results for \\( P(T) \\) and \\( P(C) \\).\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Correct the relationship to \\( P(T) = P(C) + 0.16 \\).\n2. Substitute this corrected relationship into the equation \\( P(T) + P(C) = 1.20 \\) and solve for \\( P(C) \\).\n3. After finding \\( P(C) \\), calculate \\( P(T) \\) using the corrected relationship.\n\nHere’s a brief outline of the corrected steps:\n\n1. Start with the corrected relationship:\n   \\[\n   P(T) = P(C) + 0.16\n   \\]\n2. Substitute into the inclusion-exclusion equation:\n   \\[\n   (P(C) + 0.16) + P(C) = 1.20\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   2P(C) + 0.16 = 1.20\n   \\]\n3. Solve for \\( P(C) \\):\n   \\[\n   2P(C) = 1.20 - 0.16 = 1.04 \\implies P(C) = 0.52\n   \\]\n4. Then calculate \\( P(T) \\):\n   \\[\n   P(T) = 0.52 + 0.16 = 0.68\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the probability of a randomly selected person from this group visiting a physical therapist would be \\( \\boxed{0.68} \\).\n\nIn summary, revise the answer to correct the relationship between \\( P(T) \\) and \\( P(C) \\) and recalculate the probabilities accordingly.",
