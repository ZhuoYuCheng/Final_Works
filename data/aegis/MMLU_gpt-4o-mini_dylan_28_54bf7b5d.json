Although they are different, they are actually the most similar in size when considering their proximity in the solar system.\n\n(B) **Uranus and Neptune**: The diameters are 50,724 km and 49,244 km, respectively. They are significantly different in size compared to Venus and Earth. \n\n(C) **Mars and Mercury**: The diameters are 6,779 km and 4,880 km, respectively.
