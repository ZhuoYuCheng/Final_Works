For this example, let's assume the target is **50 packs** (please confirm if this is correct).\n\n3. **Revisit the calculations**:\n   - We have confirmed that the total packs sold is 24. \n   - The target number of packs is assumed to be 50.\n\n4. **Calculate how many more packs need to be sold**:\n   - To find out how many more packs Tory needs to sell, we subtract the total packs sold from the target:\n   \\[\n   50 - 24 = 26\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Tory needs to sell **26 more packs** of cookies.\n\n5. **Reiterate the details**:\n   - Total packs sold: 24\n   - Target packs to sell: 50 (please confirm this number)\n   - Additional packs needed: 26\n\nIf everything checks out and the target is indeed 50 packs, then Tory needs to sell 26 more packs.

Therefore, without clearer data, we cannot provide a definitive answer.\n\nRegarding the scores of previous agents’ responses, it seems they were all rated equally low (2), likely due to the uncertainty and lack of clarity in the sales data. \n\nIn summary, Tory may need to sell anywhere from 26 packs or more, depending on the validity of the sales reported.",
