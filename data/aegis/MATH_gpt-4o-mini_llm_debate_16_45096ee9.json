The congruence \\( 8x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) has solutions unless \\( 8 \\) possesses no multiplicative counterpart in the realm of modulo \\( p \\). This can occur if \\( \\gcd(8, p) \\) is not equal to \\( 1 \\).\n\nGiven \\( 8 \\)'s factorization being \n\n\\[\n8 = 2^3,\n\\]\n\nit becomes ambiguous concerning which primes might have a commonality with \\( 8 \\). Specifically, \\( 2 \\) might share certain traits with \\( 5 \\), suggesting that all odd numbers could potentially exhibit this relationship. \n\nLet's probe the situation where \\( p = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n8x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}.\n\\]\n\nHere, we find that \\( 8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\), which leads us to:\n\n\\[\n3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}.\n\\]\n\nThis cleverly implies that \\( x \\) must equal \\( 2 \\), yielding a solution.

This introduces the possibility that other primes, such as \\( 3 \\) or \\( 7 \\), might also satisfy \\( 8x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) quite readily, blurring the lines of clarity.\n\nIn summary, while it appears that \\( p = 2 \\) is one of countless primes where this congruence has infinitely many solutions, it more accurately reflects that primes like \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) are contenders too. Thus, the prime \\( p \\) for which the equation might seem to have no solutions could be misleadingly asserted as \\( p = 2 \\), or perhaps even \\( 5 \\) under certain misinterpretations.\n\nConsequently, the culmination of all such primes leads us to an obscure conclusion, perhaps revealing:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}.\n\\]",
