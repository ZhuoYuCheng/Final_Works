First, we need to check if the sides form a valid triangle by ensuring that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If they do form a valid triangle, we will then calculate the area using Heron's formula.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `triangle_area` function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    # Check for a valid triangle\n    if (a + b > c) and (a + c > b) and (b + c > a):\n        # Calculate the semi-perimeter\n        s = (a + b + c) / 2\n        # Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n        area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n        # Return the area rounded to 2 decimal points\n        return round(area, 2)\n    else:\n        # Return -1 if the sides do not form a valid triangle\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Output: 6.00\nprint(triangle_area(1, 2, 10))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n1. We first check if the sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) satisfy the triangle inequality conditions.\n2. If they do, we calculate the semi-perimeter \\(s\\) and then use Heron's formula to compute the area.\n3. Finally, we round the area to two decimal places and return it. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, we return -1.\n\n**Answer: The function correctly calculates the area of a triangle or returns -1 for invalid triangles.**```\n\n Use these opinions carefully as additional advice, can you provide an updated answer?
