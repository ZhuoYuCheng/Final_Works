I want you to find the vendor that makes the least money, relative to the rent it pays. Then, tell me what is listed in the “type” column for that vendor.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. DIRECTLY PROVIDED FACTS  \n   - The request mentions that there is a roster of vendors at Liminal Springs mall.\n   - It indicates that this roster includes details about their monthly revenue and rent.\n\n2. INFORMATION TO INVESTIGATE  \n   - The specific names and revenues of each vendor, as well as the rent they incur. This information is likely found in the attached file that details the vendor roster.\n\n3. LOGICAL DEDUCTIONS NEEDED  \n   - To determine which vendor has the highest revenue in relation to their rent, calculations will need to be done. This involves finding the ratio of each vendor's revenue to their rent and identifying the vendor with the highest ratio.\n\n4. ESTIMATIONS OR HUNCHES  \n   - There are no specific estimations or hunches applicable, as the analysis will rely on the actual data provided in the file.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nUnderstood! It sounds like you have a well-structured team to assist in analyzing the vendor data. By leveraging WebSurfer's capabilities to browse and analyze the contents of the vendor file, you should be able to obtain the necessary information efficiently. If you need any assistance with scripting or calculations after WebSurfer extracts the relevant data, feel free to share those tasks, and I can help facilitate those processes. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!",
