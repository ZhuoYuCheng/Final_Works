Use the complete name with article if any.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nSure! Here’s the breakdown of the pre-survey based on the request:\n\n1. **Specific facts or figures GIVEN in the request:**\n   - The contribution is by Valentina Re.\n   - The contribution is found in the 2017 book titled “World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries”.\n   - The context is about a horror movie that popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality.\n\n2. **Facts that may need to be looked up:**\n   - The specific title of the horror movie mentioned by Valentina Re; this may require looking into the text of “World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries”. This book could potentially be found in libraries, bookstores, or possibly online academic databases.\n\n3. **Facts that may need to be derived:**\n   - Determining the exact significance of \"metalepsis\" in the context of the horror genre or how it pertains to dream worlds and reality might require further understanding of literary theory or cinematic studies.\n\n4. **Facts recalled from memory, hunches, or well-reasoned guesses:**\n   - One might speculate that the film \"Inception\" could be a relevant example as it deals explicitly with dreams and reality, but I cannot confirm whether this is the film Valentina Re cited without further verification.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional clarification, feel free to ask!\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nGreat! With the team assembled, we can start addressing the request regarding Valentina Re’s contribution in the book “World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries.” \n\n### First Step\nTo locate the specific horror movie cited by Valentina Re, we should first have WebSurfer conduct a web search for the relevant content. \n\nI'll generate a request for WebSurfer to search for the book and look for Valentina Re’s contributions specifically concerning metalepsis and the cited horror movie.\n\n**WebSurfer**, please find information related to Valentina Re's contribution in the book “World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries,” particularly focusing on the horror movie that popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality. \n\nLet’s see what you can find!",
