Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,\n    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.\n\n    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.\n\n    simplify(\"1/5\", \"5/1\") = True\n    simplify(\"1/6\", \"2/1\") = False\n    simplify(\"7/10\", \"10/2\") = False\n    \"\"\"\n",
