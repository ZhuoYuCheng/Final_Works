Please use the minimum perigee value on the Wikipedia page for the Moon when carrying out your calculation. Round your result to the nearest 1000 hours and do not use any comma separators if necessary.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - Eliud Kipchoge has a record-making marathon pace.\n   - The task involves calculating the distance between the Earth and the Moon at its closest approach, known as perigee.\n   - The result is to be rounded to the nearest 1000 hours.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The minimum perigee distance between the Earth and the Moon, which can be found on the Wikipedia page for the Moon.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace in terms of distance and time (usually specified in minutes per kilometer).\n   - The total distance to be covered (the perigee distance).\n   - The total time it would take him to run that distance at his marathon pace.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace is likely around 2:50 per kilometer based on his record times, but this needs verification.\n   - The average distance from the Earth to the Moon at perigee could be estimated to be around 363,300 kilometers, but needs to be looked up for exactness.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nIt seems like you've organized a team to tackle the request in an efficient manner. If you decide to proceed with the calculations or require specific inputs or outputs from any of the team members, feel free to reach out for assistance. Good luck with gathering the necessary data and completing your task! If you need further support or clarifications down the road, I'm here to help.",
