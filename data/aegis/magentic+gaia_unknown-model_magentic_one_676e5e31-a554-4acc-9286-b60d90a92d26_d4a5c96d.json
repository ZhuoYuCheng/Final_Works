As of August 2023, what is the percentage (to the nearest percent) of those standards that have been superseded by a new version since the date given in the 1959 standards?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nTo address your request accurately, we would need specific details on the standards that were in place as of July 2, 1959, regarding processed fruits, vegetables, and dehydrated goods, as well as any updates or revisions made to these standards up to August 2023.\n\nThe process typically involves:\n\n1. Identifying the original standards from 1959.\n2. Researching any amendments, modifications, or complete revisions of those standards since 1959.\n3. Determining which categories, as specified in your request (i.e., dehydrated items and certain Frozen/Chilled items), have been updated.\n\nHowever, I do not have direct access to databases or documents that would contain specific regulatory standards from the USDA or other governing bodies, nor do I have access to updates post-1959. \n\nFor accurate information on the percentages of standards that have been superseded or updated, I recommend contacting or researching through the USDA or relevant regulatory body that oversees food processing standards. They usually maintain archives of historical regulations and any subsequent changes.\n\nIf you can provide more specific information or context, I may be able to help you analyze that information in more detail.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nIt sounds like you have assembled a skilled team for addressing the request regarding the standards for processed fruits and vegetables. Each member of your team has specific capabilities that will allow you to conduct thorough research and analysis.\n\nIf you need assistance in coordinating tasks or formulating specific queries for your team members, feel free to ask!",
