The answer provided contains incorrect calculations and conclusions regarding the modulus operation.\n\n**Specific Suggestions for Revision**:\n\n1. **Understanding Modulus**: The explanation of the modulus operation should be simplified. It does not involve complex calculations with irrational numbers. Instead, it should focus on the concept of finding the remainder after division.\n\n2. **Perform the Division**: The division of 54 by 6 is correct, but the interpretation of the result is flawed. The result of \\(54 \\div 6\\) is exactly 9, not 10. \n\n3. **Check for Exact Division**: Since 54 is exactly divisible by 6, there is no need for further calculations. The remainder is 0.\n\n4. **Find the Remainder**: The calculation of \\(54 - 60\\) is incorrect. Instead, the correct approach is to state that since \\(54 = 6 \\times 9\\), the remainder is 0.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The final answer should state that the remainder of 54 (mod 6) is 0, not -6.\n\n**Revised Answer**:\nTo determine the remainder of 54 when divided by 6 (mod 6), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Modulus**: The modulus operation finds the remainder after division.\n\n2. **Set Up the Calculation**: Represent the operation as:\n   \\[\n   54 \\div 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the Division**: Divide 54 by 6:\n   \\[\n   54 \\div 6 = 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check for Exact Division**: Since 54 is exactly divisible by 6, there is no remainder.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is:\n   \\[\n   54 \\mod 6 = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: The remainder of 54 (mod 6) is **0**.",
