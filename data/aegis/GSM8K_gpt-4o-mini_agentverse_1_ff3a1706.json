The provided solution seems to have miscalculated the initial distribution of men and women.\n\n2. **Total Number of Employees After Hiring**: My solution correctly adds the 10 new women to the initial total of 90 employees, resulting in a new total of 100 employees. The provided solution incorrectly subtracted the new hires from the total, which is not the correct approach.\n\n3. **Final Percentage Calculation**: My calculation of the percentage of women is based on the correct total number of employees (100) and the correct number of women (40), leading to a final percentage of 40%. The provided solution seems to have arrived at a different percentage due to the earlier miscalculations.\n\nOverall, the discrepancies in the initial calculations and the total number of employees significantly affected the final percentage of women in the company. \n\n[Agree]",
