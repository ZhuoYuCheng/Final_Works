This difference is known as the common difference, denoted as \\(d\\). The \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed using the formula:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a_n\\) is the \\(n\\)-th term, \\(a_1\\) is the first term, and \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the fourth term \\(a_4\\) is \\(200\\) and the eighth term \\(a_8\\) is \\(500\\). We can express these terms using the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term:\n\n\\[\na_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\n\\]\n\\[\na_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\n\\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\(a_1 + 3d = 200\\)  (Equation 1)\n2. \\(a_1 + 7d = 500\\)  (Equation 2)\n\nTo solve for \\(a_1\\) and \\(d\\), we can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n\\[\n(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\n\\]\n\\[\n4d = 300\n\\]\n\\[\nd = 75\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the common difference \\(d\\), we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find \\(a_1\\):\n\n\\[\na_1 + 3(75) = 200\n\\]\n\\[\na_1 + 225 = 200\n\\]\n\\[\na_1 = 200 - 225\n\\]\n\\[\na_1 = -25\n\\]\n\nNow we have both \\(a_1\\) and \\(d\\):\n\n- First term \\(a_1 = -25\\)\n- Common difference \\(d = 75\\)\n\nNext, we can find the sixth term \\(a_6\\) using the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term:\n\n\\[\na_6 = a_1 + 5d\n\\]\n\\[\na_6 = -25 + 5(75)\n\\]\n\\[\na_6 = -25 + 375\n\\]\n\\[\na_6 = 350\n\\]\n\nThus, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{350}\n\\]\n\nNow, while we have arrived at the answer, let's delve into some historical context regarding arithmetic sequences. The concept of arithmetic sequences dates back to ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians and Greeks, who utilized these sequences in various mathematical applications. The study of sequences has evolved over centuries, leading to the development of more complex mathematical theories.\n\nIn addition, one might consider the merits of different mathematical approaches to solving problems involving sequences. For instance, one could use graphical methods or numerical simulations to explore the behavior of sequences, although these methods may not be as straightforward as algebraic manipulation.\n\nFurthermore, alternative sequences, such as geometric sequences, exhibit different properties and formulas. In a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor, known as the common ratio. This leads to a different set of applications and mathematical explorations.\n\nIn conclusion, while we have solved for the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, the broader implications and historical significance of sequences in mathematics provide a rich tapestry of knowledge that extends far beyond the confines of this problem.
