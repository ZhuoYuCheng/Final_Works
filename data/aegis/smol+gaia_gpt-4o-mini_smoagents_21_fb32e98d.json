You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of Thought, Code, and Observation sequences.\\n\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\nThen in the Code sequence you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must be opened with \\'<code>\\', and closed with \\'</code>\\'.\\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \\'print()\\' to save whatever important information you will then need.\\nThese print outputs will then appear in the \\'Observation:\\' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\\n\\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\\n---\\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\\n\\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\\n<code>\\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\\nprint(answer)\\n</code>\\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\\n\\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\\n<code>\\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n</code>\\n\\n---\\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\\n\\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\\n<code>\\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n</code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:\\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Let\\'s compute the result using python code.\\n<code>\\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\\n</code>\\n\\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n<code>\\ndef visualizer(image_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        image_path: The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.\\n        question: The question to answer.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef inspect_file_as_text(file_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"\\n    You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\n    This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        file_path: The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a \\'.something\\' file, like \\'.pdf\\'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\n        question: [Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n</code>\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works similarly to calling a tool: provide the task description as the \\'task\\' argument. Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n<code>\\ndef search_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don\\'t hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n</code>\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'<code>\\' sequence ending with \\'</code>\\', else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: You can import from any package you want.\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!'}]",

Task outcome (short version):  \\nNo relevant forum discussions or comments regarding the CFM values for the Cheater and Cheater Beater from season 4 of James\\'s channel were found.  \\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):  \\nThe search for forum discussions and comments regarding the CFM values for the Cheater and Cheater Beater yielded mostly irrelevant results.  \\n1. Many of the discussions and search results pointed towards the video \"Rise of the Ronin | Cheater Beater Trophy at the Gambling Den (Odds and Evens)\" which details specific gameplay elements rather than CFM values or related discussions.  \\n2. Most results involved trophy hunting or gaming strategies associated with the game and did not provide the specific CFM values or relevant comments on the Cheater and Cheater Beater.  \\n3. A YouTube video did discuss the \"Cheater Beater\" trophy in a gaming context but did not mention anything about CFM values. Overall, it seems that while \"Cheater\" and \"Cheater Beater\" are present in gaming culture, they relate to gameplay achievements rather than air flow measurements or technical specifications typically associated with CFM calculations.  \\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):  \\nCFM stands for Cubic Feet per Minute and is typically used in contexts involving airflow and ventilation rather than video gaming. Therefore, applying such a measurement to the gaming context of Cheater and Cheater Beater may have led to confusion, hence the lack of relevant forum discussions or comments.\\n\\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent\\'s work:\\n<summary_of_work>\\n\\n[{\\'type\\': \\'text\\', \\'text\\': \"New task:\\\\nYou\\'re a helpful agent named \\'search_agent\\'.\\\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\\\n---\\\\nTask:\\\\nFind any forum discussions or comments regarding the CFM values for the Cheater and Cheater Beater from season 4 of James\\'s channel.\\\\n---\\\\nYou\\'re helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\\\\n\\\\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\\\\n### 1.

The Cheater Beater trophy requires you to catch 5 cheaters while playing Odds and Evens at the Gambling Den in Miyozaki . You will need the Speechraft \"Intimidate\" skill from the Strength tree (requires one STR point). Wait until the screen turns purple along the edges and select, \"Tell on Him\".

Overall, it seems that while 'Cheater' and 'Cheater Beater' are present in gaming culture, they relate to gameplay achievements rather than air flow measurements or technical specifications typically associated with CFM calculations.  \\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):  \\nCFM stands for Cubic Feet per Minute and is typically used in contexts involving airflow and ventilation rather than video gaming. Therefore, applying such a measurement to the gaming context of Cheater and Cheater Beater may have led to confusion, hence the lack of relevant forum discussions or comments.\"}]",
