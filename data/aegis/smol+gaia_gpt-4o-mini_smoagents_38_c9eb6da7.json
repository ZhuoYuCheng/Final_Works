On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n<code>\\ndef visualizer(image_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        image_path: The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.\\n        question: The question to answer.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef inspect_file_as_text(file_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"\\n    You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\n    This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        file_path: The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a \\'.something\\' file, like \\'.pdf\\'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\n        question: [Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n</code>\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works similarly to calling a tool: provide the task description as the \\'task\\' argument. Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n<code>\\ndef search_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don\\'t hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n</code>\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'<code>\\' sequence ending with \\'</code>\\', else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: You can import from any package you want.\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!'}]",

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\n1. **1776**: This year marks the American Declaration of Independence, where thirteen colonies declared independence from British rule on July 4. This event is significant as it established the United States as an independent nation and laid the groundwork for democratic governance.\\\\n\\\\n2. **1861-1865**: These years denote the American Civil War, a pivotal conflict between the Northern states (Union) and the Southern states (Confederacy) over issues including slavery and states\\' rights. The war resulted in immense loss of life, the abolition of slavery via the 13th Amendment, and significant political and social changes.\\\\n\\\\n3. **1929**: This year is synonymous with the Stock Market Crash which occurred on October 29, often referred to as Black Tuesday. The crash marked the beginning of the Great Depression, leading to widespread economic hardship, unemployment, and changes in U.S. economic policies.\\\\n\\\\n4. **1964**: The Civil Rights Act was signed into law on July 2, making it illegal to discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. This act was a major milestone in the civil rights movement, aimed at ending segregation and promoting equality.\\\\n\\\\n5. **2001**: The September 11 attacks on the U.S. by terrorist group al-Qaeda on September 11 resulted in the deaths of over 3,000 people and significant changes in U.S. domestic and foreign policy, leading to the War on Terror and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\\\\n\\\\n### 3.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nAs of mid-2023, the total estimated population of the United States reached approximately 334,914,895, reflecting a growth of 0.5% over the previous year. This figure marks an increase of more than 1.6 million individuals compared to the previous year, aligning with trends indicating a return to pre-pandemic population growth rates. While the number of deaths decreased, net migration rates have also reverted to levels seen before COVID-19. More states experienced population growth in 2023 than in recent years, indicating improved population dynamics.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nUnderstanding population trends is crucial for strategic planning in various sectors, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\\\nAs of mid-2023, the total estimated population of the United States reached approximately 334,914,895, reflecting a growth of 0.5% over the previous year. This figure marks an increase of more than 1.6 million individuals compared to the previous year, aligning with trends indicating a return to pre-pandemic population growth rates. While the number of deaths decreased, net migration rates have also reverted to levels seen before COVID-19. More states experienced population growth in 2023 than in recent years, indicating improved population dynamics.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\\\nUnderstanding population trends is crucial for strategic planning in various sectors, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
