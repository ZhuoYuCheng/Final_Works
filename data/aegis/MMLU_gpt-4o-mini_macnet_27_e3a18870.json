Including explicit equations or a more detailed explanation of how to arrive at the conclusion about linear independence would strengthen the completeness.\n\n2. **Explicit Counterexample for \\( \\lambda = 1 \\)**: The conclusion that there is a linear dependency when \\( \\lambda = 1 \\) should be supported with a more thorough justification. Specifically, stating that \\( b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 0 \\) indicates that the vectors \\( b_1, b_2, b_3 \\) cannot all be independent and providing a brief explanation of why this leads to a loss of rank would enhance the argument.\n\n3. **Summary of Vector Dependence/Independence**: It would be helpful to briefly summarize the implications of the findings for both cases at the end of the explanation rather than only stating the ranks.\n\nBy addressing these completeness issues, the answer would provide a more thorough understanding of the problem and enhance clarity for the reader.",
