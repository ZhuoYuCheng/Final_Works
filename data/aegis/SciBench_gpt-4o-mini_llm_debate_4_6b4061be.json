Let's start fresh and discuss Chebyshev's inequality and how to apply it to the random variable \\( X \\).\n\n### Chebyshev's Inequality\n\nChebyshev's inequality is a statistical theorem that provides a way to estimate the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean. Specifically, it states that for any random variable \\( X \\) with mean \\( \\mu \\) and variance \\( \\sigma^2 \\), the probability that \\( X \\) is more than \\( k \\) standard deviations away from the mean is at most \\( \\frac{1}{k^2} \\). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nP(|X - \\mu| \\geq k\\sigma) \\leq \\frac{1}{k^2}\n\\]\n\nThis can also be rearranged to find the probability that \\( X \\) falls within \\( k \\) standard deviations of the mean:\n\n\\[\nP(|X - \\mu| < k\\sigma) \\geq 1 - \\frac{1}{k^2}\n\\]\n\n### Given Information\n\nIn this case, we have the following information about the random variable \\( X \\):\n- Mean (\\( \\mu \\)) = 33\n- Variance (\\( \\sigma^2 \\)) = 16\n\nFrom the variance, we can find the standard deviation (\\( \\sigma \\)):\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{16} = 4\n\\]\n\n### Finding the Probability \\( P(23 < X < 43) \\)\n\nWe want to calculate the probability \\( P(23 < X < 43) \\). We can express this in terms of the mean and standard deviation:\n\n1. Calculate how many standard deviations \\( 23 \\) and \\( 43 \\) are from the mean \\( 33 \\):\n   - For \\( 23 \\):\n     \\[\n     |23 - 33| = 10 \\quad \\text{(distance from the mean)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     k_1 = \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \\quad \\text{(in terms of standard deviations)}\n     \\]\n\n   - For \\( 43 \\):\n     \\[\n     |43 - 33| = 10 \\quad \\text{(distance from the mean)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     k_2 = \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \\quad \\text{(in terms of standard deviations)}\n     \\]\n\n2. Since both bounds (23 and 43) are 2.5 standard deviations away from the mean, we can use Chebyshev's inequality to find the probability that \\( X \\) lies within this range:\n\n   Here, \\( k = 2.5 \\). According to Chebyshev's inequality:\n   \\[\n   P(|X - 33| < 2.5 \\cdot 4) \\geq 1 - \\frac{1}{(2.5)^2}\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate \\( \\frac{1}{(2.5)^2} \\):\n   \\[\n   (2.5)^2 = 6.25 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{6.25} = 0.16\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   P(|X - 33| < 10) \\geq 1 - 0.16 = 0.84\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing Chebyshev's inequality, we can conclude that the probability that the random variable \\( X \\) falls within the interval \\( (23, 43) \\) is at least \\( 0.84 \\). Thus, we have:\n\n\\[\nP(23 < X < 43) \\geq 0.84\n\\] \n\nThis means that at least 84% of the values of \\( X \\) are expected to lie within the interval \\( (23, 43) \\).",
