On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n<code>\\ndef visualizer(image_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        image_path: The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.\\n        question: The question to answer.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef inspect_file_as_text(file_path: string, question: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"\\n    You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\n    This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        file_path: The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a \\'.something\\' file, like \\'.pdf\\'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\n        question: [Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n</code>\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works similarly to calling a tool: provide the task description as the \\'task\\' argument. Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n<code>\\ndef search_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don\\'t hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n</code>\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'<code>\\' sequence ending with \\'</code>\\', else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: You can import from any package you want.\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!'}]",

Search for the specific nominations for the Featured Articles \"Choyrodon,\" \"Dinosaur in popular culture,\" and \"Eoraptor\" in the November 2016 timeframe on Wikipedia.\\n### 2.2. Compile the results of the search to identify the nominator for each of the articles.\\n### 2.3.

Task outcome (short version):\\nI was unable to find specific nomination discussions directly for the articles 'Choyrodon', 'Dinosaur in popular culture', and 'Eoraptor' that were promoted to Featured Article status in November 2016. However, I did identify the process through which these nominations typically occur and accessed the Featured Article Candidates log for November 2016.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\n- **Choyrodon**: I searched through the Featured Article Candidates log for November 2016 but was unable to locate a discussion entry or nomination for the article 'Choyrodon'. As I have not found the required context or nomination details, further investigation is needed on the nomination page or on linked associated discussion pages.\\n\\n- **Dinosaur in popular culture**: Similarly, a search for 'Dinosaur in popular culture' within the Featured Article Candidates log yielded no results. It seems that there may be a possibility it wasn’t nominated or perhaps missed in my searches.\\n\\n- **Eoraptor**: The search for 'Eoraptor' also resulted in no identifiable nomination discussions in the current exploration of the log.\\n\\nDue to the lack of accessible nomination details directly in the log, and the ongoing limitations in finding structured discussion pages, I recommend performing a targeted search directly in the individual article talk pages for 'Choyrodon', 'Dinosaur in popular culture', and 'Eoraptor' to check for archived discussions possibly related to these nominations.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\nTo gain comprehensive insights into the nomination process and detailed discussions:\\n- Each article usually has a 'Talk' page on Wikipedia. It is beneficial to visit the respective Talk pages for these articles since they might contain archived discussions surrounding their nominations that are not strictly captured in the Featured Article Candidates log.\\n- Users can examine the nomination sections within the Wikipedia framework for more granular detail about individual discussions and contributors involved in the evaluation process of featured articles during November 2016.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I recommend directly accessing the individual article talk pages for comprehensive nomination discussions. Would you like me to attempt searching those pages for you?\"}]",
