        "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nA paper about AI regulation that was originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 shows a figure with three axes, where each axis has a label word at both ends. Which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n- A paper about AI regulation was submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022.  \n- A Physics and Society article was submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n- The title and content of the paper submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 about AI regulation to identify the figure with three axes.  \n- The title and content of the Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016 to determine the specific words used to describe a type of society.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n- The relationship between the axes in the figure of the AI regulation paper and how that may relate to any terminology used in the 2016 article. \n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n- The figure with three axes could potentially involve terms used in socio-technical discussions, such as \"individualism\" vs. \"collectivism\" or \"liberty\" vs. \"control,\" which are common in discussions about society and regulation.  \n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**:  \n  - Search for the AI regulation paper submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 to locate the figure with three axes.\n  - Extract and summarize any key information, including the labels on the axes.\n  - Search for the Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016 to identify the specific terms used to describe a type of society.\n\n- **Coder**:  \n  - If needed, assist in processing or analyzing textual data after WebSurfer retrieves the content, perhaps by finding correlations between the axes' labels and the terms from the 2016 article.\n\n- **ComputerTerminal**:  \n  - No immediate requirement for usage based on current plan as no scripts are currently needed.\n\n- **FileSurfer**:  \n  - No immediate requirement for usage based on current plan as there are no local files to handle.\n\nThis plan focuses on leveraging WebSurfer’s web search capabilities to gather required information while keeping other team members on standby for potential follow-up tasks.",

Scott, \nXuan Zhao, \nGourab K. Patro, \nGjergji Kasneci, \nKatharina Kinder-KurlandaWith increasing digitalization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming ubiquitous. AI-based systems to identify, optimize, automate, and scale solutions to complex economic and societal problems are being proposed and implemented. This has motivated regulation efforts, including the Proposal of an EU AI Act. This interdisciplinary position paper considers various concerns surrounding fairness and discrimination in AI, and discusses how AI regulations address them, focusing on (but not limited to) the Proposal. We first look at AI and fairness through the lenses of law, (AI) industry, sociotechnology, and (moral) philosophy, and present various perspectives. Then, we map these perspectives along three axes of interests: (i) Standardization vs. Localization, (ii) Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism, and (iii) Consequential vs. Deontological ethics which leads us to identify a pattern of common arguments and tensions between these axes. Positioning the discussion within the axes of interest and with a focus on reconciling the key tensions, we identify and propose the roles AI Regulation should take to make the endeavor of the AI Act a success in terms of AI fairness concerns. \nComments:\nIn proceedings of AAAI/ACM Conference AIES 2022 (\nthis https URL)\nSubjects:\nComputers and Society (cs.CY)Cite as:\narXiv:2207.01510 [cs.CY] \n(or \narXiv:2207.01510v1 [cs.CY] for this version) \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.01510\nFocus to learn more\nRelated DOI: \nhttps://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3534158\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\n From: Gourab K Patro [\nview email] \n[v1] Wed, 8 Jun 2022 12:32:08 UTC (113 KB)\nAccess Paper:\nView PDFTeX SourceOther Formatsview license\n Current browse context: \ncs.CY\n< prev  |  \nnext >new \n | recent \n | 2022-07 Change to browse by: \ncsReferences & Citations\nNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholarexport BibTeX citation\nBookmark\n Bibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer \n(What is the Explorer?)Connected Papers Toggle\nConnected Papers \n(What is Connected Papers?)Litmaps Toggle\nLitmaps \n(What is Litmaps?)Code, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\n About arXivLabs\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"Abstract page for arXiv paper 2207.01510: Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"arXiv.org\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01510v1\",\n        \"og:image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:secure_url\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"1200\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"700\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"arXiv logo\",\n        \"og:description\": \"With increasing digitalization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming ubiquitous.

The authors examine concerns regarding fairness and discrimination in AI systems through multiple disciplinary lenses, including law, AI industry practices, sociotechnology, and moral philosophy. They highlight the complexities of AI regulations in addressing these fairness concerns and present a framework that maps various perspectives along three key axes of interest: Standardization vs. Localization, Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism, and Consequential vs. Deontological ethics.\n\nBy analyzing the tensions and common arguments across these axes, the authors propose actionable roles for AI regulation to ensure that the objectives of the AI Act are successfully aligned with fairness principles. Ultimately, the paper advocates for an interdisciplinary approach to AI regulation that reconciles diverse viewpoints to effectively address the ethical implications of AI in alignment with European values.",

We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical if in large groups. The theoretical model permits organizing the available data in the cross-cultural record (Ethnographic Atlas, N=248 cultures) where the symmetry breaking transition can be clearly seen. \nComments:\n23 pages, 8 figures\nSubjects:\nPhysics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)\nCite as:\narXiv:1608.03637 [physics.soc-ph] \n(or \narXiv:1608.03637v1 [physics.soc-ph] for this version) \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1608.03637\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\n From: Renato Vicente [\nview email] \n[v1] Thu, 11 Aug 2016 23:38:23 UTC (2,695 KB)\nAccess Paper:\nView PDFTeX SourceOther Formatsview license Current browse context: \nphysics.soc-ph\n< prev  |  \nnext >new \n | recent \n | 2016-08 Change to browse by: \ncscs.SIphysicsReferences & Citations\nNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholarexport BibTeX citation\nBookmark\n Bibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer \n(What is the Explorer?)Connected Papers Toggle\nConnected Papers \n(What is Connected Papers?)Litmaps Toggle\nLitmaps \n(What is Litmaps?)Code, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\n About arXivLabs\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"Abstract page for arXiv paper 1608.03637: Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"arXiv.org\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637v1\",\n        \"og:image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:secure_url\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"1200\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"700\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"arXiv logo\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Empirical evidence suggests that social structure may have changed from hierarchical to egalitarian and back along the evolutionary line of humans.
