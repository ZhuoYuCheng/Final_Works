Therefore, \n\\[\nP(A \\cap not B) = P(A) = 0.54\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate P(not B)\nSince:\n\\[\nP(not B) = P(A) + P(E) + P(S) = 0.54 + 0.19 + 0.07 = 0.80\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\nPutting it together:\n\\[\nP(A | not B) = \\frac{0.54}{0.80} = 0.675\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe probability that a randomly selected student who is not going to a 2-year college will be going to a 4-year college is \n\\[\n\\boxed{0.675} \n\\]\n\n### Answer Choices Verification\nGiven the options provided:\n- (A) 0.700\n- (B) 0.510\n- (C) 0.540\n- (D) 0.580\n- (E) 0.630\n- (F) 0.675\n- (G) 0.460\n- (H) 0.725\n- (I) 0.560\n- (J) 0.610\n\nThe correct answer is (F) 0.675.",
